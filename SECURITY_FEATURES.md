# D-Iden Security Features Implementation

This document outlines the security features implemented in the D-Iden application to protect user data, digital identities, and wallet information.

## 1. Biometric Authentication

### Implementation Details

Biometric authentication has been implemented throughout the application to provide a secure and convenient way for users to access sensitive information. The implementation includes:

- **Fingerprint/Face Recognition**: Leveraging device biometric capabilities via the `local_auth` package
- **Configurable Settings**: Users can enable/disable biometric authentication through the Security Settings screen
- **Session Authentication**: Wallet access requires biometric verification each time
- **Transaction Security**: Additional biometric authentication required for sending funds

### Key Components:

- `SecurityService.authenticateWithBiometrics()`: The core method that handles the biometric authentication process
- `SecurityProvider`: Manages application-wide security state and authentication status
- `_authenticateAndLoadWallet()` in `WalletDashboardScreen`: Ensures wallet content is only visible after successful authentication

## 2. Data Encryption

### Implementation Details

Sensitive data in the application is encrypted to ensure it cannot be read even if unauthorized access to the device storage occurs:

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Industry-standard encryption algorithm
- **Secure Key Management**: Encryption keys are stored in the device's secure storage
- **Transparent Usage**: Encryption/decryption happens automatically when reading/writing sensitive data

### Key Components:

- `SecurityService.encryptData()`: Encrypts sensitive strings
- `SecurityService.decryptData()`: Decrypts encrypted data
- `SecurityProvider.encryptData()` and `SecurityProvider.decryptData()`: Provider methods that interface with the service

## 3. Secure Storage

### Implementation Details

Rather than storing sensitive data in regular app storage, secure storage is used to leverage platform-specific security features:

- **Platform-Specific Security**: Uses Keystore on Android and Keychain on iOS
- **Key-Value Storage**: Sensitive information is stored with secure keys
- **Automatic Clearing**: Options for clearing sensitive data on conditions like too many failed authentication attempts

### Key Components:

- `SecurityService.secureWrite()`: Stores data in secure storage
- `SecurityService.secureRead()`: Retrieves data from secure storage
- `SecurityProvider.secureStore()` and `SecurityProvider.secureRetrieve()`: Provider methods for secure storage operations

## 4. Session Authentication Flow

The application implements a session authentication flow, which means that access to sensitive screens requires authentication. The flow works as follows:

1. When the user navigates to a sensitive screen (e.g., Wallet Dashboard):
   - The app checks if biometric authentication is enabled
   - If enabled, the user is prompted for biometric authentication
   - If authentication fails, the content is not displayed

2. For extra sensitive operations (e.g., sending funds):
   - Additional biometric authentication is required regardless of recent authentication
   - This provides an extra layer of security for critical operations

3. Authentication UI:
   - Clear messaging explaining why authentication is needed
   - Option to retry authentication if it fails
   - Feedback for successful/unsuccessful authentication attempts

## 5. PIN Protection

In addition to biometric authentication, PIN protection provides an alternative authentication method:

- **Configurable Requirements**: Options to require PIN always, for transactions only, or disabled
- **Warning Dialogs**: Clear warnings when attempting to reduce security levels
- **Integration with Biometrics**: Works alongside biometric authentication as a fallback

## Implementation in Security Settings

The Security Settings screen provides a user-friendly interface for managing security features:

- Toggle switches for enabling/disabling biometric authentication
- Radio buttons for configuring PIN requirements
- Clear feedback when settings are changed
- Reset option for returning to default security settings

## Security Best Practices

The implementation follows security best practices:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security (biometrics, PIN, encryption, secure storage)
- **Least Privilege**: Only showing sensitive information when necessary
- **Clear Feedback**: Users are informed about security-related actions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative methods when primary security features fail
- **Secure by Default**: Security features are enabled by default

## Future Security Enhancements

Potential security enhancements for future updates:

1. **Remote Wipe**: Allow users to remotely wipe sensitive data if device is lost
2. **Activity Logs**: Track and display security-related activities
3. **Certificate Pinning**: Enhance API communication security
4. **Jailbreak/Root Detection**: Detect compromised devices
5. **Automatic Timeout**: Lock the app after a period of inactivity
